# DOST: Distance-preserving Optimization for Spatial Transcriptomics

DOST is a distance-preserving optimization based method that clusters
spatial transcriptomics (ST) spots into spatial domains. DOST embeds ST
spots into a low-dimensional space using a Sammon mapping inspired loss
function that jointly preserves gene expression similarity and spatial
smoothness.
