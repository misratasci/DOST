# DOST: Distance-preserving Optimization for Spatial Transcriptomics

**DOST** is an R package for identifying spatial domains in spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. It is a distance-preserving optimization based method that clusters ST spots into spatial domains. DOST embeds ST spots into a low-dimensional space using a Sammon mapping inspired loss function that jointly preserves gene expression similarity and spatial smoothness.

## Installation

You can install the development version of DOST from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("misratasci/DOST")

```

## Documentation & Tutorials

For a full reproduction of the spatial domain identification of the DLPFC dataset from our paper, please see the [DLPFC Vignette](vignettes/DLPFC.Rmd).
